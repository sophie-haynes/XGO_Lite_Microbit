# XGO_Lite_Microbit
This repository contains a easy to run program for the XGO lite with microbit. 
Link to the MakeCode can be found here: [https://makecode.microbit.org/_5JgXgDeyEgYd]](https://makecode.microbit.org/_R82P8iH1k2cJ)

# Running the Code
With the microbit connected, drag the `InteractiveDog.hex` file onto the microbit. This will only take a few seconds. 

## Functionality
The `InteractiveDog.hex` file contains the following interactions:
1. Toggle Silent Mode

    Holding the 🅰️ button on the microbit will toggle *Silent Mode* on and off. When off, all audio output will be disabled, as well as audio *input*. This can be helpful for when using XGO remote control app to make the XGO move (loud movements will trigger the onLoud function), or if the makebit gets stuck in the onLoud function. 

2. Happy Dog

    Activate by pressing the gold microbit logo at the top of the microbit.

3. Polite Dog

    Activate by pressing 🅰️ once

4. Rude Dog

    Activate by double-clicking 🅰️ 

5. Sneaky Dog

6. Excited Dog
